# mansli7.github.io

Static Jekyll site for the Mansli7 Bible study portal.

## Current Structure

- `/` is the default English home page.
- Entry pages use a one-language-at-a-time experience controlled by shared language state.
- Study-question book content remains split under `/bs/sq/en/` and `/bs/sq/zh/`.
- Annual reading plan table pages remain split under `/bs/ar/2026-en` and `/bs/ar/2026-zh`.
- The calendar page at `/bs/ar/2026-calendar` follows the shared site language preference.

## Language Switching

- Site-wide language preference is stored in `localStorage` under `mansli7-site-lang`.
- Shared language logic lives in `assets/js/site-lang.js`.
- The default layout sets `html[data-site-lang]` before render to avoid flashing the wrong language.
- Entry pages use `.card-en` and `.card-zh` blocks, with layout CSS showing only the active language.
- Global language controls are wired through `data-lang-switch` buttons in the nav and homepage hero.
- On study-question book pages and annual-plan table pages, switching language also localizes the route when an equivalent page exists.

## Key Files

- `_layouts/default.html`: early language initialization, global language CSS gating, shared scripts, and homepage widgets.
- `_includes/nav.html`: desktop and mobile navigation plus global language switch controls.
- `assets/js/site-lang.js`: storage, switch syncing, event dispatch, and route localization.
- `index.md`: homepage hero language controls and single-language entry content.
- `bs/ar/index.md`: annual reading-plan hub.
- `bs/ar/2026-calendar.md`: shared-language calendar experience.
- `bs/sq/index.md`: study-question hub that links into existing `en` and `zh` book trees.

## Editing Notes

- When adding a new study-question book, update the book links on `bs/sq/index.md` and the slug maps used by the layout/home widgets.
- If a new page should obey the site-wide language switch, prefer `.card-en` and `.card-zh` blocks instead of duplicating routes.
- Keep raw downloads under `assets/downloads/`.
